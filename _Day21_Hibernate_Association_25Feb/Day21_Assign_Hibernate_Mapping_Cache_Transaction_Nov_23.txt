3> create class Customer{
	private int customerId;
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private String phoneNo;
	private String email;
	private LocalDate dob;
	private Policy policy;
}
 create class Policy {
	private int policyId;
	private String policyName;
	private double premiumAmount;
}

->) write the above classes with 2 scenarios
a> one to many (one customer having many policies)
create 2 Customer object and each 2 Policy. Save and fetch the Customer and Policy in OTMCustomerPolicyMain class.

b> one to one (one customer having one policy)
create 1 Customer object and each 1 Policy. Save and fetch the Customer and Policy in OTOCustomerPolicyMain class.


3> create class Store{
	private int storeId;
	private String storeName;
@ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name = “store_product”,
           joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = “fk_store”) },
           inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = “fk_product”) })
    private Set<Product> products = new HashSet<Product>();
}
 create class Product {
	private int productId;
	private String productName;
	private double productAmount;
	@ManyToMany(mappedBy=”products”)
    	private Set<Store> stores = new HashSet<Store>();
}

a) write the above classes using many to many (many Store having many Product ) Refer Demo created during session for Many to Many relations ship.
b) create 2 stores object and each stores have 2 products.
persist and fetch the stores and product in MTMStoresProductMain class.
