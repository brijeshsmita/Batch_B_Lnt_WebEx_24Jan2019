**********Notes for Creating a LocalDate********
You can create a LocalDate in several ways. The first way is to obtain a LocalDate corresponding to the local date of today. Here is an example of creating a LocalDate using the now() method:

LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.now();
Another way to create a LocalDate is to create it from year, month and day information, like this:

LocalDate localDate2 = LocalDate.of(2015, 12, 31);
The LocalDate's of() method creates a LocalDate instance representing a specific day of a specific month of a specific year, but without time zone information.

Accessing the Date Information of a LocalDate
You can access the date information of a LocalDate using these methods:

getYear()
getMonth()
getDayOfMonth()
getDayOfWeek()
getDayOfYear()
