1> Database -> CREATE TABLE EMP123(EID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, ENAME VARCHAR2(30),ESAL NUMBER);
create sequence emp123_seq start with 1;
2> add driver to the project classpath -> copy paste the ojdbc6.jar file into lib folder created in your project
	right click on the jar file and build path -> Add to build path 
3> obtain connection
4> talk to database (SQL -structured query language)
	C -CREATE/ADD/INSERT -> INSERT INTO EMP123 values(emp123_seq.nextval,'SMita',9999.99);INSERT INTO EMP123 values(emp123_seq.nextval,'Sia',5599.99);INSERT INTO EMP123 values(emp123_seq.nextval,'Ria',7899.99);
	commit; /*DML operations need to committed*/
	R -READ/RETREIVE -> SELECT * FROM EMP123;
	U -UPDATE/MODIFY ->  UPDATE EMP123 SET ename='smita kumar' where eid=1;
	D -DELETE/REMOVE -> DELETE FROM EMP123 where eid=1;
	S -SEARCH/FIND  -> SELECT * FROM EMP123 where eid=1;
5> By obtaining Statement/PreparedStatement/CallableStatement object -(to fire Sql queries)
	Statement-> to fire simple SQL Queries
	PreparedStatement-> to fire pre-compiled SQL Queries (provides better performance ,thus must be used instead of Statement)
	CallableStatement-> to fire execute Stored Procedures
6> ResultSet -> stores the data(rows) fetch by the above statement execution.
